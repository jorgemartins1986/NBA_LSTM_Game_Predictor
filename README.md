# NBA Game Predictor - Ensemble Model

## 📋 Overview

An ensemble-based NBA game prediction system combining multiple models with stacking and Platt calibration. The system uses rolling team statistics, ELO ratings, and Dean Oliver's Four Factors to predict game outcomes.

**Current ensemble accuracy: ~64.5%** (realistic for sports prediction; market edge is typically 52-55%)

### Models in the Ensemble
| Model | Type | Accuracy | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------||
| XGBoost | Gradient Boosting | 64.71% | Tree-based learner with tuned hyperparameters |
| Random Forest | Ensemble Trees | 63.68% | Robust ensemble with feature selection (top 40) |
| Logistic Regression | Linear | 63.37% | L2-regularized baseline with balanced class weights |
| LSTM | Neural Network | 65.33% | Attention-enhanced deep learning |

Predictions are combined via **ensemble voting** with optional **stacking meta-learner** and **Platt calibration**.

### Architecture (v2.0)

The codebase uses **dependency injection** and **factory patterns** for testability:

```python
# Example: Training with injectable dependencies
from src.training import EnsembleTrainer, EnsembleConfig

config = EnsembleConfig(architectures=['xgboost', 'logistic'])
trainer = EnsembleTrainer(config=config)
result = trainer.train(matchup_df)

# Example: Prediction with injectable loader
from src.prediction import PredictionPipeline, ModelLoader

loader = ModelLoader()
ensemble = loader.load_ensemble()
pipeline = PredictionPipeline(ensemble)
result = pipeline.predict(game_features)
```

---

## 💰 Betting Odds Integration (Optional)

The system can optionally fetch live bookmaker odds to:
- Display odds alongside model predictions
- Show "value" when model disagrees with the market
- (Future) Use odds as training features

### Setup

1. Get a free API key from [The-Odds-API](https://the-odds-api.com/) (500 free credits/month)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $env:ODDS_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   
   # Or permanently in your profile
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ODDS_API_KEY", "your_key", "User")
   ```
3. Run predictions - odds will appear automatically:
   ```bash
   python main.py predict
   ```

### What You'll See

```
🏆 Predicted Winner: Boston Celtics
📊 Confidence: 32.5%
🏠 Home Win Prob: 66.2%
✈️  Away Win Prob: 33.8%
💰 Bookmaker Odds: Home 1.52 (66%) | Away 2.65 (38%)
🔥 Value: Model 66.2% vs Market 65.8% (+0.4%)
```

### API Costs

| Endpoint | Credits | What You Get |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Live odds | 1/call | Today's games from EU bookmakers |
| Historical | 10/call | One date of historical odds |

With 500 free credits/month: ~500 live calls or ~50 historical dates

---

## 🔄 Training the Ensemble

### Full Training

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
1. Load/update game data from cache (or download if first run)
2. Prepare matchup features with chronological split (80% train / 20% test)
3. Compute all features: rolling stats, ELO, H2H, standings, fatigue
4. **Export enriched datasets to CSV** (`cache/nba_matchups.csv`)
5. Train all 4 models: XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LSTM
6. Apply sample weighting (recent games weighted more heavily)
7. Build stacking meta-model and Platt calibrator
8. Save all artifacts to `models/`

**Training time:** ~10-20 minutes (depending on hardware)

---

## 🎯 Bet Quality Tiers

The prediction output includes bet-quality tiers based on model confidence:

| Tier | Confidence | Probability | Recommendation |
|------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 🔥 EXCELLENT | 50%+ | 75%+ | Strong edge |
| 💰 STRONG | 40-50% | 70-75% | Good value |
| ⚡ GOOD | 30-40% | 65-70% | Moderate edge |
| 📊 MODERATE | 20-30% | 60-65% | Small edge |
| ❓ RISKY | 10-20% | 55-60% | Marginal |
| ⛔ SKIP | <10% | <55% | No edge |

**Model Agreement** indicates how much the 4 models agree (higher = more confidence in the prediction).

## � Prediction History & Tracking

The system automatically tracks all predictions and results for performance analysis.

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run predictions (auto-saves to history)
python main.py predict

# 2. Next day: update with actual results
python main.py --updateresults

# 3. View detailed accuracy statistics
python main.py --stats
```

### History File Format

Predictions are saved to `reports/prediction_history.csv`:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `date` | Prediction date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `away_team` | Away team full name |
| `home_team` | Home team full name |
| `prediction` | Predicted winner |
| `winner` | Actual winner (filled after game) |
| `confidence` | Model confidence (0-1, distance from 50%) |
| `home_win_prob` | Home win probability (0-1) |
| `model_agreement` | How much models agreed (0-1) |
| `tier` | Bet quality tier (EXCELLENT/STRONG/GOOD/MODERATE/RISKY/SKIP) |
| `correct` | 1 if correct, 0 if wrong |

### Update Results Commands

```bash
# Update yesterday's results (default)
python main.py --updateresults

# Update specific date
python main.py --updateresults 2026-01-17

# Update all pending results
python main.py --updateresults --all

# View detailed statistics only
python main.py --stats
```

### Statistics Output

The `--stats` command shows comprehensive breakdown:
- **Overall accuracy** with date range
- **By bet quality tier** with estimated ROI
- **By confidence level** (10 granular buckets)
- **By model agreement** (6 buckets)
- **By home win probability** (calibration check)
- **Time-based performance** (3/7/14/30 days)
- **Day of week analysis**
- **Streaks** (current, best win, worst loss)
- **Profitable filters** (combinations that beat the vig)

### Recommended Retraining Schedule

- **Daily**: Run predictions (data is fresh via API)
- **Every 2 weeks**: Full retrain with `python train.py`
- **When accuracy drops**: Check stats and retrain if needed

---

## �🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No games found for today"
- Check if it's the off-season or no games scheduled
- NBA API live scoreboard only shows games on game days

### "Not enough data for prediction"
- Team needs at least 20 games played in current season
- Early season predictions may be unreliable

### Module import errors
```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate       # Mac/Linux

# Then run
python predict_with_ensemble.py
```

### Low accuracy after retraining
- Ensure chronological split is used (shuffle=False)
- Check that all 4 models trained successfully
- Verify stacking artifacts were saved

---

## � Enriched Datasets

Training automatically exports portable CSV datasets you can use in other projects:

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `nba_games_cache.csv` | 8 MB | Raw game data from NBA API |
| `nba_games_enriched.csv` | 70 MB | Games with all rolling features |
| `nba_matchups.csv` | 37 MB | **28,000+ matchups with 117 features** |

The `nba_matchups.csv` contains the complete feature-engineered dataset ready for ML:
- Rolling statistics (20-game window)
- ELO ratings and differentials
- Head-to-head historical records
- Standings at time of each game
- Fatigue indicators (rest days, B2B, 3-in-4)
- Target variable: `HOME_WIN` (1/0)

**Use in other projects:**
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('cache/nba_matchups.csv')
X = df.drop(['GAME_ID', 'GAME_DATE', 'HOME_WIN', 'HOME_TEAM_ID', 'AWAY_TEAM_ID'], axis=1)
y = df['HOME_WIN']
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and research purposes only**. Sports betting involves significant risk. Historical accuracy does not guarantee future results. Always gamble responsibly.

**Realistic expectations:** Professional sports bettors typically achieve 52-55% accuracy. This model aims for 60-65%, providing a potential edge but not guaranteed profits.
